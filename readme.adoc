== üîé Overview

The *Robot-Conga* project demonstrates coordinated leader‚Äìfollower locomotion in a multi-agent system.  
It leverages physics simulation via *PyBullet* to model quadruped robots following a sequential path, similar to a "conga line" of robots.

This project can be extended for:
- Swarm robotics research
- Reinforcement learning
- Path-following experiments

---

== üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- *Python* ‚Äì Primary programming language
- *PyBullet* ‚Äì Physics simulation and rendering of quadruped robots
- *NumPy / Matplotlib* ‚Äì Numerical computation and visualization (if included in requirements)
